            We are Electric Eels and we are based in Chandler, Arizona. This is
            currently our second year doing NURC. We are composed of two FTC
            teams, BinaryBots and Da Geese of Freedom, that merged to become a
            NURC team. We merged these two teams because the majority of the
            team members had an interest in NURC. Our twelve team members help
            to represent over six chandler-area schools.

            BinaryBots 18445, founded in 2021 as an FTC team, was previously an
            FRC team for five years (2015-2020). As the pandemic ended the 2020
            season early, the team switched over to FTC. We are a co-ed team,
            which means that anyone, regardless of gender identity, can join our
            team. We currently have 8 members ranging from 7th grade to 9th
            grade, though we accept members from 7th to 12th grade. Our mission
            as a team is to provide opportunities to everyone through the use of
            STEM and FIRST. Our team is hosted by the Si Se Puede Foundation
            (SSPF), which provides us with a workspace, as well as most of the
            materials and tools we work with. As our parent sponsor, the Si Se
            Puede Foundation lets us use their STEM center as a workspace. The
            Si Se Puede Foundation also provides a variety of tools such as 3d
            printers, a laser cutter, and routers.
